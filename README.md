Welcome to visit my site: https://eightsmilefy.com/?cat=26. 

Posts may not be kept updated, in that it seems the website cannot show `.md` and `jupyter notebook` well. Still, welcome to vista my website for some insights about Econ and my learning & ideas.

Both my website and GitHub cannot  show those Latex formula correctly. If that showing bother you, please clone the .md file yourself. Hope that would be helpful.
