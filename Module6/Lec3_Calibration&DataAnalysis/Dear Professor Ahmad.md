Dear Professor Ahmad,

Hope you are doing well.

This is Fanyu, and I wondering if I can ask about a subtle question for M6L3?

In the 36th Slide of the lecture note (and section 3.1 of your paper 'Fear and Greed in the F.I. Mkt'). A logritham is taken as the following,

$$\begin{equation}\begin{split} log(v^2r^{2\beta}\delta t) &= log (v^2 \delta t) + log(r^{2\beta}) \\ &=   2log(v \delta t) + 2\beta\  log(r)\end{split}\end{equation}$$

However, my thought is the equation should be, $ 2log(v\sqrt{\delta t}) + 2\beta\  log(r)$. Sorry for disturbing you before if my question is too much subtle. 

By the way, may I also ask why a logritham shell be taken? or Shell I ask why we consider the RHS to be exponential of a linearity?

Best wishes,

Fanyu
